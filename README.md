# Code Reactions ‚Äî Emoji reactions for any Git repo

> Add emoji reactions, even with comments, to any Git repo! React and see others 
> reactions to any piece of code straight from your IDE.

Code Reactions is an open-source extension for Visual Studio Code, made with love
with a mind to give back to the community.

You see some nice piece of code? Now you can add a üëç, or maybe a üòç if you loved it
so much.

This sees like it might be a bug there? Give it a üêõ with a comment on your finding 
and come back to fix it.

This code really has a smell... I think it might justify a üí©. We should at some point
come around to scooping all of these.

We give you the ability to react the code, you decide how to use it!

## Features and how to use

**In its core there is only a single feature:**
>**React and see reactions to any code**

There are different ways supported by this extension to achieve that. 
All of them can be individually toggled on/off from the settings so feel free to 
choose the ones that work best for you!

### Status Bar Reactions
1. `Select any lines of code` and `see how many reactions` it has on the status bar.
2. `Hover` over the reaction and see by how many people
3. `Click` any emoji to react to these lines yourself

### React with Comment
1. `Select any lines of code` and right click
2. Choose `Add Reaction With Content > Any reaction`
3. Add your comment and press `Enter`

### Inline Reactions
1. `Select any lines of code` and see how many reactions it has next to your cursor.
2. `Hover` over it and see `when` by `whom` and any `comment` they left

### Annotate Code with Reactions
1. Right click on any file lines and select `Toggle Reaction Annotations`
2. `See easily next to each line` any reaction they have.
3. `Hover` any of them so see `when` by `whom` and any `comment` they left

### Reactions Feed
1. Click on the `Reactions:Feed` Panel
2. See a chronological list of all repo reactions

### Notifications
Get `instantly notified` for any reactions to either `the repo`, or specifically `your code`.

### Supported Reactions
In the future we would like to support any native emoji. Until we figure out
how to do that in a nice UI way this is the list of supported emojis:

| Emoji | Designation | 
|-------|-------------|
|    üëç   | :like:      |
|    üëé   | :dislike:   |
|    üêõ   | :bug:       |
|    üí©   | :poop:      |
|    üöÄ   | :rocket:    |
|    ü§î   | :thinking:  |
|    üòç   | :heartEyes: |
|    üëÄ   | :eyes:      |
